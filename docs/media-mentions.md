# Aletheia-Probe Media Mentions

Last updated: **February 13, 2026**

This document summarizes known media and institutional mentions of Aletheia-Probe from early February 2026. All links below are directly clickable.

## Priority Mentions

1. **Nature (Technology Feature, 2026-02-02, Matthew Hutson)**  
   Link: [https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-026-00223-6](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-026-00223-6)  
   Nature presents Aletheia-Probe as a practical “one-stop shop” for assessing journal and conference legitimacy by combining signals from multiple sources that may disagree when checked individually. The feature explains the tool’s origin (created by Andreas Florath while screening a large review corpus), its command-line workflow, and its explainable output labels (`LEGITIMATE`, `PREDATORY`, `INSUFFICIENT_DATA`) with confidence scores. It also includes balanced critique: open-source transparency is praised, but dependence on some blacklist-style inputs and command-line usability are identified as limitations for broader adoption.

2. **University of Bonn Open Access Service Center (institutional guidance page; no single article timestamp)**  
   Link: [https://www.open-access.uni-bonn.de/en/basics/predatory-publishing](https://www.open-access.uni-bonn.de/en/basics/predatory-publishing)  
   This is not a news article but a persistent guidance resource on predatory journals/conferences that explicitly includes Aletheia-Probe in its recommended toolset. The page places the tool alongside established checklists and directory-based validation practices, and documents expected usage/output categories (`LEGITIMATE`, `PREDATORY`, `INSUFFICIENT_DATA`) plus command-line invocation. This mention is important because it indicates institutional operationalization of the tool in publication-integrity advice.

## Additional Verified Mentions

3. **Phys.org (2026-02-03, Paul Arnold)**  
   Link: [https://phys.org/news/2026-02-access-software-tool-fake-journals.html](https://phys.org/news/2026-02-access-software-tool-fake-journals.html)  
   Phys.org frames predatory publishing as a fraud risk for both authors and readers, then positions Aletheia-Probe as an automated defense that scans curated lists and metadata ecosystems to flag warning patterns. The article emphasizes that the tool is not a black-box binary classifier: it returns reasoning plus a confidence score so humans can make the final decision. It also highlights current maturity limits (real-world validation and broader source expansion still needed) while pointing readers to the arXiv paper and GitHub project.

4. **pressetext (pte20260205002, 2026-02-05 06:00, German)**  
   Link: [https://www.pressetext.com/news/-aletheia-probe-findet-forschungs-fake-news.html](https://www.pressetext.com/news/-aletheia-probe-findet-forschungs-fake-news.html)  
   pressetext describes Aletheia-Probe as software that uncovers pseudo-scientific publication venues by querying several major databases in parallel and correlating their findings. Its summary focuses on two technical ideas: digital-footprint checks (for example in OpenAlex/Crossref) and confidence-scored interpretation rather than yes/no verdicts. The piece explicitly notes that users should make the final judgment themselves, with the tool providing transparent supporting evidence for that decision.

5. **Dementia Researcher / NIHR (2026-02-03, Nature Careers repost/adaptation)**  
   Link: [https://www.dementiaresearcher.nihr.ac.uk/is-this-journal-legitimate-this-tool-can-help-you-decide](https://www.dementiaresearcher.nihr.ac.uk/is-this-journal-legitimate-this-tool-can-help-you-decide)  
   This page republishes/adapts the Nature Careers narrative for a research-community audience, preserving the core points on predatory-journal risk, cross-source evidence gathering, and transparent tool output. It repeats the practical workflow and confidence-labeled results, and also carries the same caution that command-line usage can limit accessibility. In documentation terms, this is best treated as secondary distribution that extends reach rather than an independent deep technical review.

6. **Substack / AcademAI (2026-02-07, Santhosh Eapen)**  
   Link: [https://santhosheapen.substack.com/p/aletheia-probe?r=2ri45e&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&triedRedirect=true](https://santhosheapen.substack.com/p/aletheia-probe?r=2ri45e&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&triedRedirect=true)  
   This long-form commentary focuses on the Indian academic context and argues that Aletheia-Probe addresses a real integrity gap but remains operationally inaccessible for many researchers because it requires command-line skills. The author highlights systemic pressures (publication metrics, funding/career incentives, APC exposure) and recommends interface-level improvements such as web/mobile front ends, stronger local-list integration, and institutional support workflows. The post is supportive of the core approach while emphasizing deployment and usability barriers outside technically strong environments.

7. **WorldNews (WN) aggregator (posted 2026-02-03, source-attributed to Phys.org)**  
   Link: [https://article.wn.com/view/2026/02/03/Openaccess_software_tool_helps_researchers_spot_fake_journal](https://article.wn.com/view/2026/02/03/Openaccess_software_tool_helps_researchers_spot_fake_journal)  
   The WN entry is an aggregator-style snippet that references the Phys.org story and repeats its central message about explainable scoring for legitimacy checks. Its visible text is abbreviated (“read full story”), so its value is primarily distribution/visibility rather than new reporting or additional technical detail. For traceability, this should be classified as syndicated mention coverage.

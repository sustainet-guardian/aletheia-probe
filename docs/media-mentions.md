Last updated: **February 15, 2026**

This document summarizes known media and institutional mentions of Aletheia-Probe from early February 2026. All links below are directly clickable.

## Part 1 - Official Universities and Research Organizations Linking to Aletheia-Probe

1. **University of Bonn Open Access Service Center (institutional guidance page; no single article timestamp)**  
   Link: [https://www.open-access.uni-bonn.de/en/basics/predatory-publishing](https://www.open-access.uni-bonn.de/en/basics/predatory-publishing)  
   This is a standing institutional guidance resource on predatory journals and conferences that includes Aletheia-Probe in its recommended toolset. The page places the tool alongside established checklists and directory-based validation practices, and documents the output categories (`LEGITIMATE`, `PREDATORY`, `INSUFFICIENT_DATA`) plus command-line usage. This mention indicates institutional use in publication-integrity guidance.

2. **University of Pittsburgh Library System (LibGuide: "Evaluating Publication Venues")**  
   Link: [https://pitt.libguides.com/academic-publishing/venue](https://pitt.libguides.com/academic-publishing/venue)  
   This institutional guide includes Aletheia-Probe in its "Checklists and Tools" section alongside Think. Check. Submit., Be iNFORMEd, and MIAR. It describes Aletheia-Probe as an open-source, multi-source assessment tool and points readers to the README for usage details. This is a clear university-library reference for practical venue-evaluation workflows.

3. **Dementia Researcher / NIHR (2026-02-03, Nature Careers repost/adaptation)**  
   Link: [https://www.dementiaresearcher.nihr.ac.uk/is-this-journal-legitimate-this-tool-can-help-you-decide](https://www.dementiaresearcher.nihr.ac.uk/is-this-journal-legitimate-this-tool-can-help-you-decide)  
   This page republishes/adapts the Nature Careers coverage for a research-community audience. It retains the main points on predatory-journal risk, multi-source evidence, and confidence-scored outputs, while repeating the usability caution around command-line workflows. This should be classified as secondary distribution rather than independent reporting.

## Part 2 - News

1. **Nature (Technology Feature, 2026-02-02, Matthew Hutson)**  
   Link: [https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-026-00223-6](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-026-00223-6)  
   Nature presents Aletheia-Probe as a practical multi-source tool for assessing journal and conference legitimacy. The feature covers the project origin, command-line workflow, and explainable output labels (`LEGITIMATE`, `PREDATORY`, `INSUFFICIENT_DATA`) with confidence scores. It also provides balanced critique, noting both open-source transparency and adoption limits tied to blacklist dependencies and CLI usability.

2. **Phys.org (2026-02-03, Paul Arnold)**  
   Link: [https://phys.org/news/2026-02-access-software-tool-fake-journals.html](https://phys.org/news/2026-02-access-software-tool-fake-journals.html)  
   Phys.org frames predatory publishing as a fraud risk and positions Aletheia-Probe as an automated, evidence-based screening tool. The article emphasizes transparent reasoning and confidence scoring rather than black-box classification, and notes current maturity limits (validation scope and source expansion). It links to the arXiv paper and GitHub repository.

3. **pressetext (pte20260205002, 2026-02-05 06:00, German)**  
   Link: [https://www.pressetext.com/news/-aletheia-probe-findet-forschungs-fake-news.html](https://www.pressetext.com/news/-aletheia-probe-findet-forschungs-fake-news.html)  
   pressetext describes Aletheia-Probe as software that identifies questionable publication venues through parallel checks across major databases. It highlights digital-footprint analysis (for example OpenAlex/Crossref) and confidence-scored interpretation instead of binary verdicts. The article explicitly states that final decisions remain with the user.

4. **Substack / AcademAI (2026-02-07, Santhosh Eapen)**  
   Link: [https://santhosheapen.substack.com/p/aletheia-probe?r=2ri45e&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&triedRedirect=true](https://santhosheapen.substack.com/p/aletheia-probe?r=2ri45e&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&triedRedirect=true)  
   This long-form commentary focuses on the Indian academic context. It argues that Aletheia-Probe addresses a real integrity gap, while noting adoption barriers for researchers without command-line experience. The post recommends interface and deployment improvements (for example web/mobile front ends and stronger institutional integration) while remaining supportive of the core approach.

5. **Library Learning Space (Research Support, 2026-02-12)**  
   Link: [https://librarylearningspace.com/open-source-tool-to-help-assess-predatory-journals-and-conferences/](https://librarylearningspace.com/open-source-tool-to-help-assess-predatory-journals-and-conferences/)  
   This outlet lists Aletheia-Probe in its Research Support coverage and summarizes the same core narrative seen in early February reporting. It presents the tool as an open-source aid for evaluating predatory journals and conferences, with emphasis on practical researcher guidance. This should be classified as secondary distribution coverage rather than primary technical reporting.

6. **WorldNews (WN) aggregator (posted 2026-02-03, source-attributed to Phys.org)**  
   Link: [https://article.wn.com/view/2026/02/03/Openaccess_software_tool_helps_researchers_spot_fake_journal](https://article.wn.com/view/2026/02/03/Openaccess_software_tool_helps_researchers_spot_fake_journal)  
   This is an aggregator-style snippet attributed to the Phys.org story. It repeats the main message on explainable scoring for legitimacy checks, with limited visible text and no additional technical reporting. This should be classified as syndicated distribution coverage.

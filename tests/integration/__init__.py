"""Integration tests for Aletheia-Probe.

INTEGRATION TEST FILE: This directory contains integration tests that verify
component interactions and end-to-end workflows. These are NOT predictable
unit tests - they may make real external API calls and use fuzzy assertions.

See README.md in this directory for details on integration test characteristics
and how to interpret test failures.

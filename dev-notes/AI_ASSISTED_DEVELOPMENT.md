# AI-Assisted Development

This project explicitly encourages and welcomes the use of AI coding agents as part of the development workflow. AI tools are valuable for:

- Code generation and refactoring
- Writing tests and documentation
- Code review and quality improvement
- Problem-solving and debugging
- Learning and exploring the codebase

**Guidelines for AI-Assisted Contributions:**

1. **Review and Verify**: All AI-generated code must be thoroughly reviewed, tested, and understood before submission
2. **Quality Standards**: AI-assisted code must meet the same quality standards as manually written code (see [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md))
3. **Transparency**: Contributors may optionally indicate AI assistance in commit messages or PR descriptions using tags like `[AI-assisted]` for transparency
4. **Responsibility**: Contributors remain fully responsible for all submitted code, regardless of how it was generated
5. **Security**: Extra attention should be paid to security implications of AI-generated code

For detailed guidelines on using AI coding agents with this project, see [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md).
